# cricket_news

A real-time cricket news app showcasing 'Top News' and 'Recent News'. Clicking on any news opens the details of the news with a link to the article source and a 'Share' button to share on various social media apps, mail and message.

I made use of following Flutter plugins:

http: for making REST api calls.

flutter_linkify: to make hyperlinks clickable.

url_launcher: to open the hyperlinks in device / emulator browser.

share: To share articles on various supported social media apps, email and messaging.

bubble_tab_indicator: to highlight current tab selected.
